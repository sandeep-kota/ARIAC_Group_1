[Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition) (ARIAC) is a simulation based competition organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Collaboration with IEEE CASE, every year since 2017.  The purpose of ARIAC is to investigate robot agility by utilizing the latest advances in artificial intelligence, robot planning and control. Specifically, ARIAC focuses on challenging robotic agility in manufacturing environments. This project is build around [ARIAC 2020](https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC/tree/ariac2020) competition, which is implemented in ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.16 simulator.

## Goal of ARIAC 2020 Challenge
The premise of ARIAC 2020 is to build kits of different types of products based on received orders from the system. To build this kits, a gantry robot with two UR10 arms attached to its torso and vacuum grippers can be moved around a warehouse to retrieve the parts from each order. These parts can be found in shelves and bins. The robot picks up the parts and places them on a specified AGV. Once a kit is completed, the AGV is shipped to fulfill an order. ARIAC 2020 presents the following agility challenges include high priority order, faulty parts, faulty gripper, flipped parts, sensor blackout and moving obstacles.  Some of the tools used for this competition include C++, ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt and ROS TF.

## Ariac Environment

The environment consists of a gantry robot, 2 AGVâ€™s on either side of the shop floor, multiple shelvesand bins, a conveyor belt and moving obstacles. The parts are located within the bins and shelves.However, some parts also come from the conveyor belt but they are in continuous motion and disappearwhen they reach the end of the belt.  The shelves are arranged in a way to create four aisles.  Thereare two moving obstacles that can be found from any of the aisles.

## Knowledge Representation
There are different kinds of knowledge representations based on the information we have, ranging from ordinary glossaries to general logic. Following is the knowledge model of the objects and behaviors implemented in our project. For each object in the project, appropriate attributes and behaviors are identified.

## Agility Challeneges

ARIAC 2020 has the following agility challenges
1)  <b> Faulty Products :</b> Certain parts in the shop floor are faulty but can only be identified one on the AGV.
2) <b> Flipped products :</b> Certain parts need to be flipped before placing them on the AGV.
3) <b> Dropped Products :</b>  The gripper becomes faulty at various instances. This leads to either incorrect pose on the AGV or  may not be placed on the AGV at all.
4) <b> In-process order interruption :</b> In the middle of an order, another other is placed which need to  be delivered prior the the initial order. (The new order have a higher priority).
5) <b> Sensor Blackout :</b> At a certain time, communications from the sensors will be lost, but the system needs to continue to process the orders.
6) <b> Moving Obstacles :</b> Moving Obstacles (humans) are present in the shop floor and the robot should plan to avoid collision.

## Run Instructions
 - The launch directory of the package `/rwa5_group_1` has a launch file `rwa5.launch`. All the necessary nodes will be launched within this node.

 ```
source ~/ariac_ws/devel/setup.bash

roslaunch rwa5_group_1 rwa5.launch load_moveit:=true
 ```

 - Run the rwa5 node 
 ```
source ~/ariac_ws/devel/setup.bash

rosrun rwa5_group_1 rwa5_node
 ```
